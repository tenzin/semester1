                    The kingdom of Bhutan is located in the Himalayas between India and China. It has a total area of 38,394 square kilometers.
                    <!-- The information on land area of Bhutan is referred from National Statistical Bureau, Bhutan (http://www.nsb.gov.bt)-->

                    Bhutan lays strong emphasis on preservation and promotion of cultural traditions and environment. As such, age old cultural festivals are being preserved and promoted to this day. Bhutan also has approximately 72% of the total land area under forest cover with ten national parks and santuaries.
                    <!-- This number is referred from Tourism council of Bhutan -->
                </p>

                    This has helped Bhutan project itself as a tourist destination. People visit Bhutan to experience its unique tradition and culture, to see its intact environment and rich biodiversity, to trek along the Himalayan ranges and to participate in river rafting and moutain biking.
